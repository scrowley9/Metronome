The goal is to connect an arduino metronome program to a muscle stimulator device and use the pulse to try and improve my rhythm when playing piano.
Inspired by The Artist Formerly Known as Prince + Jacob Collier and their insane rhythm.

METRONOME YOU CAN FEEL
Arduino Metronome - https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Metronome/

TODO</br>
1  - Write a sound ticker on your computer</br>
2  - Learn about the hardware of a pregnancy simulator and how it works</br>
<ul>
	<li>Cheap (cause I just need a decent pulse)</li>
	<li>Dangers of putting the pads around heart?</li>
	<li>Once you get a simulator determine the best place on the body to feel a beat (think about the rhythm)</li>
</ul>
3  - Determine the best microcontroller for this</br>
<ul>
	<li>arduino nano is realllly cheap</li>
	<li>How will I fit it together with the pregnancy simulator</li>
</ul>
4  - Get the microcontroller</br>
5  - Implement sound tick code for the microcontroller</br>
6  - Connect pregnancy simulator device to microcontroller to control pulse</br>
7  - Tick == Pulse</br>

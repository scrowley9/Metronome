The goal is to connect an arduino metronome program to a muscle stimulator device and use the pulse to try and improve my rhythm when playing piano.
Inspired by The Artist Formerly Known as Prince + Jacob Collier and their insane rhythm.

METRONOME YOU CAN FEEL

TODO
1  - Write a sound ticker on your computer
2  - Learn about the hardware of a pregnancy simulator and how it works
	> Cheap (cause I just need a decent pulse)
	> Dangers of putting the pads around heart?
	> Once you get a simulator determine the best place on the body to feel a beat (think about the rhythm)
3  - Determine the best microcontroller for this
	> Price.. ehh
	> How will I fit it together with the pregnancy simulator
4  - Get the microcontroller
5  - Implement sound tick code for the microcontroller
6  - Connect pregnancy simulator device to microcontroller to control pulse
7  - Tick == Pulse
